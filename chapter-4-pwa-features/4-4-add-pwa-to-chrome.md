# Chapter 4 - Understanding PWA Features
## Lesson 4 - Add PWA to Chrome

This lesson shows you how to install the React PWA app as a Chrome browser app.

The instructor builds the app and renders it. Then opens a Chrome browser that is not is guest mode or incognito mode. In the top right of the browser the icon (three stacked dots) can be clicked and there is an option to "Install Art Videos for Fun and Learning". Clicking this will confirm with you if you want to install the app. The instructor is using a Mac and the app is intalled to "Applications/Chrome Apps/Art Videos for Fun and Learning".

With the app installed you can open a new tab and Chrome gives you an icon in the top left called "Apps". If you click this you can see the apps. If all went well you will see the moon image, which the manifest setup in an earlier lesson, with the text from the manifest "name" property "Art Videos for Fun and Learning". This is your app icon. If you click on the icon/image it will load our new PWA app in a new Chrome window.

[ch1 Using the PWA checklist]
ISSUE(s):
* The url provided does not display the same content as the course video.
  It is possible that Google updated the page, or you need to have an active account and logged in to see what the instructor is seeing.

[ch2-1 Using create-react-app]
ISSUE(s):
* The instructor fails to mention how to use a template to create a React app for a PWA. This failure becomes apparent in Chapter 3-3 when talking about a file that does NOT exist (serviceWorker.js)

The command would be `npm create-react-app my-application cra-template-pwa`

[ch2-4 Install serve]
ISSUE(s):
* The instructor installs the serve npm package globally. It would help to stop and explain the pros and cons of installing packages locally vs globally.


[ch3-1 Using Lighthouse]
ISSUE(s)
* The "Audit" tab in Google Dev Tools is DEPRECATED. Google currently uses the "Lighthouse" tab. Likewise, the interface is different by replacing the "Run Audits" button with "Analyze page load".


[ch3-3 Register a service worker]
ISSUE(s)
* The command `npm create-react-app my-application` command does NOT generate a   "src/serviceWorker.js" file.
To correct this error in the instruction, you can create your own "src/service-worker.js" file and wire it up to "index.js",etc. 
Or you can use a template from the beginning (which should have been done to begin with)

The command would be `npm create-react-app my-application cra-template-pwa`

The issue starts back in Chapter 2.
  In chapter 2-1 it shows using `npx create-react-app my-application` to create a new React application.

  In chapter 2-2 it shows using the course exercise files with "npm i" to install dependencies. The final result is a React project with a "serviceWorker.js" file.

  The problem is when you run `npm create-react-app my-application` on your own environment it does NOT automatically create a "serverWorker.js" file.

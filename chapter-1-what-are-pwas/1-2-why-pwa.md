# Chapter 1 - What Are PWAs?
## Lesson 2 - Why PWAs?

A Google study suggests that 53% of users will abandon a website if it takes longer than 3 seconds to load.

Once the app loads it better be fast/responsive. Users connect with different speed networks so optimizing your app will benefit all users.

You might create a PWA if it:
- should be installed on the homescreen
- works reliably over varying networks
- performs conversions, or collects data from users

Some of the benefits of a PWA:
- platform agnostic (Android, iOS, etc)
- no app store
- less storage space needed
- only need web technologies (JS, HTML, CSS) to create apps

# Chapter 1 - What Are PWAs
## Lesson 3 - Using the PWA Checklist

On Google's developer website there are several pages dedicated to PWAs. Not only is this a good resource for PWAs, but an excellent source for improving the quality of web sites. Google provides a PWA tutorial, a PWA checklist as a guideline of what determines a Progressive Web App. Google also provides a tool, called *Lighthouse* to help test for compliance of items on the PWA checklist.

Google's Developer website [Progressive Web Apps](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps)

Additionally, Google provides a [PWA course](https://web.dev/learn/pwa)

Google's Developer website provides a [PWA Checklist](https://web.dev/articles/pwa-checklist) to describe what makes an app installable & usable by all users.

Base Progressive Web App Checklist
- the site must be served over https
- pages are responsive on tablets & mobile devices
- all app urls load while offline
- metadata provided for Add to Home screen
- first load is fast on 3G
- site works cross-browser
- page transitions don't feel like they block on the network,
  they should be snappy even on a slow network

Google even provides tools that can help you verify many items on the checklist. One tool is called *Lighthouse*.<br>
You can read the [Introduction to Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/) on Google's developer website.

Introduction
-----------------------
As developers we are always looking for ways to make things faster and more performant for our users. We want users to be engaged with our products and mobile devices are one way to engage with our users. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) have gained popularity as a way to use web technologies to build apps that act like native mobile apps.

  * Web Browser 
  * Native application
  * Built for the web, acts like a native app
  * Works regardless of browser choice
  * Responsive

Large popular companies such as the Washington Post, Twitter, etc. have found the value in PWAs in increasing user engagement and reducing data use.

The instruction provides a Google study that says 53% of users will abandon a site if it takes longer than 3 seconds to load.

NOTE: I think this is a low estimate. As a front-end developer the goal was always to build an intuitive interface that loads quickly (2 seconds or less) and if there is a delay to clearly inform the user (don't keep them guessing or waiting). Even without a delay a clear User Interface is key in reducing time the user takes to find what they are looking for.
